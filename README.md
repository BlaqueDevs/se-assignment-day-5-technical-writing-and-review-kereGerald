Break up large chunks of text Strategically place subheadings to improve readability5. The text following a subheading should be 250-350 words.

Consider hierarchy Ensure appropriate ordering using higher-order headers (H1) and lower-order ones (H2, H3) denoting subsections nested under overarching themes.

Test readability Read headings and subheadings aloud to evaluate how easily they flow together.

Avoid colons or brackets Extra punctuation can make the subheading more difficult to scan.

Keep subheadings relevant Use short and relevant words to describe the paragraph’s content3. Ensure the subheading closely aligns with the opening sentence.

Add variation and creativity Incorporating creativity into your subheadings not only lends an element of surprise but significantly improves the flow of your content.

Add a leading sentence before a bullet point list Don’t include bullet lists directly after subheadings, as this can confuse readers.

Don’t change the font of the subheadings Keep your fonts consistent, unless the brand guidelines specify otherwise.

Maintain enough white space between subheadings and paragraphs White space supports readability and literacy.
